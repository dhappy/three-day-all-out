# Three-Day All-Out

This software is to coordinate the 24⁄7 development of a piece of software.

Developers schedule concurrent sessions with overlap to fascilitate transitions.

It is polite for a Navigator to give ½hour of warning before ending the session unless it is coming up on its latest ending time.

So when the event is bid there's bounds on the start time and bounds on the end time.

Navigators, once chosen as a subsequent event, approve the next Navigator. The maximum end time must overlap at least ½hour with the next starting time.

So, potential events are easily visible & there's a system for managing invitations to postcede.

There could be UI for searching through jobs with a Navigator, but no Driver or Witness.

The Driver or Navigator can approve the Witness, with the Navigator having override ability.

A choice should be changable until a week before the event is to happen. At that point, a new complete overlapping series is required to be submitted to trigger a change.
